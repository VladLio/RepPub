A more completed test has been done with Randomized deleted pointers. Randomized number is coef 0.8 * 10e6 allocations and 0.6.  List of random pointer is filled before the test. 
A second random was made (between 0,1000), for number of consecutive deleted pointer. ( because normal distribution touch equally each pages, so no deleted page intervene)  
Random is the great Mersenne c++ uniform distribution. 
Graph memory result speak for me.
